## Entropy 

### Introduction: the second law of thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics may be stated in may equivalent ways, and one is as follows: spontaneous (and irreversible) processes increase the entropy of the universe.  Here entropy may be thought of as the amount of disorder.  'Disorder' is a somewhat vague term, and so in statistical mechanics entropy is defined as the number of states a system can exist in, with more possible states corresponding to higher entropy.  Spontaneous processes are those that occur during the passage of time without any external input.  

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

The second law may also be stated as follows: the amount of disorder in the universe increases over time. 

These sorts of definitions abound when entropy is discussed, but before proceeding to examine how accurate they are it is helpful to understand what thermodynamics is, and where entropy came from.  Thermodynamics is the study of heat change over time, just like the name implies.  This study got underway during the 19th century when engineers attempted to make steam engines more efficient, and so the theory of thermodynamics predates atomic theory by many decades.  

Another phrasing of the second law goes like this: energy flows from heat to work but not back again.  The second law is often thought of as a universal law of nature, just as is the case for the first law of thermodynamics (energy can be neither created nor destroyed). 

### What does it matter where the second law came from?

The source of the second law is important because it was derived using assumptions which, while useful, are not accurate.  Specifically, the ideal gas law ($PV = nRT$) was used to calculate isothermal gas expansion that was then used to calculate the change in entropy over time ([see here])(https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Thermodynamics/The_Four_Laws_of_Thermodynamics/Second_Law_of_Thermodynamics).  This is important because no gas is actually ideal: real gases all exhibit attractive forces that do not exist in the ideal gas equations.  

Derivation aside, the evidence behind the second law of thermodyanmics mostly comes from the heat engines (such as steam turbines).  Such evidence can give us some very useful information, but can it be expected to provide a fundamental law of nature?  

### A thought experiment: an endothermic reaction in space

A classic thought experiment that challenges the interpretation of the second law of thermodyamics as stated above is Maxwell's demon. 

We can think of a much simpler experiment: an exothermic, negatively entropic reaction floating in the cold vacuum of space, billions of light years from any other matter.  Specifically, perhaps we are dissolving concentrated HCl in water in a little test tube, thereby reducing the number of positions water molecules may exist in. Now the standard interpretation is that this reaction produces heat which spreads to the outside universe, thereby increasing total entropy.  So our floating reaction radiates heat into space but does this increase the universal entropy, in the statistical mechanical sense? Not unless the radiation encounters matter, which may never occur. Will the reaction still proceed even though there actually a decrease in universal entropy?  Of course!  

Here we have a spontaneous process that does not increase the entropy of the universe, but it seems somewhat trite, a hodgepodge of astrophysics and chemistry.  How many floating test tubes are there, disobeying the second law of thermodynamics? But it is here because it is instructive: although the entropy of the universe does not actually increase during this process, the potential for increased entropy at some future time does occur. This is because the ratiation of energy

### The strong nuclear, electromagnetic, and gravitational forces all decrease entropy

Gravity is perhaps the easiest to see as an entropy-decreasing force, so lets start there.  

What about at scales more relavant to our existance: does an increase in entropy over time always occur?  At a scale slightly smaller than our own, there is indeed.

### Brownian motion converts heat to work, albeit briefly. 

The chaotic motion of small particules (pollen grains) in water is called Brownian motion.  


### Entropy and the second law, restated

A more accurate definition of the second law may be as follows: especially at our size scale, energy tends spread out as time proceeds.  Using this definition, it is more accurate to think of entropy as the dissipation of energy that occurs during many spontaneous processes. 


### Dissipation of energy is equivalent to phase space dissipation 


### Dissipative nonlinear dynamical systems yield fractals
