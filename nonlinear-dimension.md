## Nonlinear tranformations change attractor dimension

Here 'nonlinear transformations' is taken to mean the set of all equations that are nonlinear (ie any non limited to unary exponents) or piecewise linear.

### Maps from finite to infinite are nonlinear

Topological dimension and scaling (fractal) dimension are equivalent for the classical objects in which topological dimension is defined: a point is 0-dimensional, a line 1-dimensional, a plane surface two-dimensional etc. 

[insert curve mapping line segment to all reals]

### Changes in dimension require infinite maps

see also space-filling curve length

### Aperiodic, bounded maps are discontinuous

This was shown using analytical methods [here](/most-discontinuous.md).  Here is another with a different approach.

A bijective mapping from two dimensions to one is necessarily discontinuous (a proof is found in Pierceâ€™s Introduction to Information Theory, and found at the end of [this page](/neural-networks.md)).  


### Dimension-changing maps are undecidable 

Space-filling Hilbert or Peano curves require an infinite number of recursions.  Infinitely recursive functions are undecidable, and therefore space-filling curves are undecidable.  

Dimension-changing maps require an infinite number of recursions as well, and therefore dimension-changing maps are undecidable.
