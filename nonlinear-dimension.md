## Nonlinear tranformations as routes between dimensions

Here 'nonlinear transformations' is taken to mean the set of all equations that are nonlinear (ie any non limited to unary exponents) or piecewise linear.

### Nonlinear transformations from finite to infinite length

In set-theoretic geometry, there are as many points in a line of finite length than there are in the entire real number line, which is of infinite length.  This means that there can be some function $f$ that maps each point of a finite line segment to each point on the number line, or in other words that there is some function $f$ that maps a finite length onto an infinite one bijectively.  


In summary, an object in one dimension of finite length may be mapped to the entire real line 

[insert curve mapping line segment to all reals]



### Changes in dimension require infinite maps

Topological dimension and scaling (fractal) dimension are equivalent for the classical objects in which topological dimension is defined: a point is 0-dimensional, a line 1-dimensional, a plane surface two-dimensional etc. 

see also space-filling curve length

### Curves are not entirely one-dimensional

Here dimension is not fractal or topological, but a definition based on the transformations that can result from a function.  Take an arbitrary line existing on a plane.  In some orientation, this line may be defined entirely on the basis of another line that exists alone, ie in one dimension.  

Now note that this is not the case for an arbitrary curve on a plane: this curve by definition is not congruent to any of the lines mentioned above. The curve may be mapped to a line, but it is not equal in that it cannot be substituted for any line.  Therefore a curve cannot be defined in one dimension, because otherwise it would be congruent with a line.

This idea extends to curved surfaces in three dimensions.  Such surfaces are not entirely planar but exist in three dimensions, and therefore are not congruent with a topologically two-dimensional plane. 

This goes to suggest that curves of any kind exist between topological dimensions, which provides a clear reason why nonlinear transformations are capable of attaining a fractional dimension.

### Aperiodic, bounded maps are discontinuous

This was shown using analytical methods on [this page](/most-discontinuous.md) for dimensions 1 and 2.  Here is another with a different approach:

A bijective mapping from two dimensions to one is necessarily discontinuous (a proof is found in Pierceâ€™s Introduction to Information Theory, and found at the end of [this page](/neural-networks.md)).  


### Dimension-changing maps are uncomputable

Space-filling Hilbert or Peano curves require an infinite number of recursions.  Infinitely recursive functions are undecidable, and therefore space-filling curves are undecidable.  

Dimension-changing maps require an infinite number of recursions as well, and therefore dimension-changing maps are undecidable. For more on decidability, see [here](/solvable-periodicity.md).


### Additivity and infinite subsets

What does it mean that nonlinear transformations are not additive, which in symbols is

$$
f(a+b) \neq f(a) + f(b)
$$

in the sense that how can this come about?  Intuitively, this means that the transformation specified by $f$ is different at different locations, such that the location $a+b$ is a different transformation than that which is found at $a$ or $b$ and that simply performing the transformation at $a$ then at $b$ is not sufficient to predict the transformation at $a+b$.  In sense, the transformations are unique.

But this remains a somewhat counter-intuitive idea. We can define the set of all possible transformations for any given $f$ as $\mathscr S$.  Now as all finite quantities can be added, elements $a$ and $b$ of $\mathscr S$ are not finite.  An infinite set is equivalent to one of its proper subsets, meaning that inside elements $a$ and $b$ there are more of $a$ and $b$.  This perhaps makes it intuitively mmore understandable as to why these elements cannot be added.

Now recall that nonlinear transformations are usually aperiodic and that bounded, aperiodic maps form self-similar fractals. The observations that $a \in a$ (proper subset) gives a clear reason why such objects exist: each fractal image $i$ contains a smaller version of itself, meaning that $i \in i$ (proper subset, as the smaller version does not contain all points of the larger).  

### Infinite recursion in nonlinear transformations

The images of fractals on this site are examples of recursion without a base case.  In the natural numbers with addition, 1 is the base case for which succession acts to make all other numbers.  A recursive base case is the smallest indivisible unit. 

For nonlinear transformations that yield fractal objects, there is no recursive base case because every object is equivalent to a smaller version of itself. 

### Nonlinearity and problem solving

Nonlinear systems are not additive (see above), meaning that they cannot be broken down into parts and re-assembled again.  As we have seen for fractals, attempting to isolate a small portion of a nonlinear map may simply lead to the presence of the entire map in miniature (a property called self-similarity).  

Now this is a serious challenge to any attempt to understand nonlinear systems because so much of human thought (or at least current problem solving thought) operates by the principle of additivity.  For example, if one builds a house then the a foundation is made, the walls go up, and the roof is set.  Or if a computer program is written, each individual variable is defined and operations are enumerated.  The same is true of practically every discipline of knowledge: smaller pieces are added together to make the final outcome.  

In the models of nonlinear equations on this webpage, computer programs were used to represent the behavior of various nonlinear transformations.  These programs work by dividing each problem into smaller versions of the same problem until a finite case is reached.  For example, a program that observed the behavior of a particle over time first divides the time period into maybe 500000 individual time steps and then proceeds to calculate the behavior as if each time step were itself indivisible.  Or perhaps we wish to understand which points in the complex plane diverge to infinity and which do not: in this case a certain resolution for the plane, perhaps 1400x2000, is chosen and then the maximum number of iterations is specified such that the program eventually halts. 

In either case, the program generates (albeit high-resolution) approximations of the actual object.  These objects are necessarily approximations any machine that attempts recursion without a base case will never halt.  This is why Turing's construct of a machine $T(a, a, x)$ never halts, ie the search for a solution to the problem 'Does a Turing machine with the input $a$ as the program it runs on halt at time x?' is undecidable inside the system because it does not halt.

### Why nonlinear transformations are typically not additive

The underlying point here is that one arrives at problems when attempting to add infinite quantities, or in other words that infinite quantities are non-additive.  As we saw earlier, nonlinear transformations have the capacity to map finite regions onto infinite, and indeed any fraction of the whole finite region may be mapped onto an infinite region.  Because of the introduction of infinite quantities, nonlinear transformations are not additive. 

### A concrete example of non-additivity

To show how a infinite quantities lead to the inability of additivity, consider the following problem: a hybrid car (perhaps a prius) is driving along a road that is relatively flat.  The car dislays the gas milage at each point along the trip, and we assume that this display is accurate.  In this particular trip, the gas engine runs continually such that gas is continually consumed.  How does one calculate the overall fuel economy, or distance travelled per unit of fuel consumed for the trip?  In the absence of any other information, one could simply record the fuel economy at each second of the trip and take the average of these numbers to gain a pretty good estimation. 

But now suppose that the road has a hill such that the car uses no fuel for a certain amount of time (perhaps it shuts off the engine and coasts or else uses the electric motor).  In this case, the fuel economy for this section is infinite: there is a positive distance travelled $d$ but no fuel consumed $c$, so $f_e = d/c = d/0 \to infty \; as \; c\to 0$.  If we then use the method above for determining fuel economy for the whole trip, we find that there is infinite economy.  But this is not so: a finite amount of fuel was consumed during the trip in total, which proceeded a finite distance, meaning that the true economy must be finite.  

The problem here is the introduction of the infinite quantity. The system is no longer additive once this occurs, and therefore one cannot use fuel economy at each time point and add them together for an accurate measure of total economy.  

### Why nonlinear transformations are not additive, from a set-theoretic perspective

At the risk of belaboring the point, here is yet more work to show that nonlinear transformations are generally not additive.

Sets cannot be partitioned arbitrarily.  To see that this statement is true, consider what happens if we try to partition a set $A$ into partition sets $S_1, S_2, S_3 ...$ where members are larger than the other members of the partition.  It is not clear which elements belong with which others, or even if an element belongs in its own set.

Somewhat surprisingly, the only way to partition a set is via an equivalence class: each element in a given partition $e_1 \in P$ must be somehow equivalent to each other element $e_2, e_3, ... \in P$.  For example, suppose that we want to partition the set of natural numbers $\Bbb N$ based on size: numbers larger than 5 in one partition, numbers smaller or equal to 5 in another.  The equivalence of each partition is its relation to the number 5: either all larger or all smaller (or the same size). 

Now consider a set where each object is different.  


### Infinite sets are self-similar

Nonlinear maps often yield self-similar fractals.  Here is a reason as to why this is: if we accept that nonlinear transformations are generally decribed by infinite sets, and that $A \in A$ (proper subset) is true for any infinite set, it necessarily follows that some subset of a map of a nonlinear transformation is equal to the entire set.  

From this perspective, self-similarity is a consequence to any non-linear transformation.
