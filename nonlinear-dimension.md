## Nonlinear tranformations change attractor dimension

Here 'nonlinear transformations' is taken to mean the set of all equations that are nonlinear (ie any non limited to unary exponents) or piecewise linear.

### Maps from finite to infinite are nonlinear

Topological dimension and scaling (fractal) dimension are equivalent for the classical objects in which topological dimension is defined: a point is 0-dimensional, a line 1-dimensional, a plane surface two-dimensional etc.  An object in one dimension may be

[insert curve mapping line segment to all reals]

### Changes in dimension require infinite maps

see also space-filling curve length

### Curves are not entirely one-dimensional

Here dimension is not fractal or topological, but a definition based on the transformations that can result from a function.  Take an arbitrary line existing on a plane.  In some orientation, this line may be defined entirely on the basis of another line that exists alone, ie in one dimension.  

Now note that this is not the case for an arbitrary curve on a plane: this curve by definition is not congruent to any of the lines mentioned above. The curve may be mapped to a line, but it is not equal in that it cannot be substituted for any line.  Therefore a curve cannot be defined in one dimension, because otherwise it would be congruent with a line.

This idea extends to curved surfaces in three dimensions.  Such surfaces are not entirely planar but exist in three dimensions, and therefore are not congruent with a topologically two-dimensional plane. 

This goes to suggest that curves of any kind exist between topological dimensions, which provides a clear reason why nonlinear transformations are capable of attaining a fractional dimension.

### Aperiodic, bounded maps are discontinuous

This was shown using analytical methods on [this page](/most-discontinuous.md).  Here is another with a different approach:

A bijective mapping from two dimensions to one is necessarily discontinuous (a proof is found in Pierceâ€™s Introduction to Information Theory, and found at the end of [this page](/neural-networks.md)).  


### Dimension-changing maps are undecidable 

Space-filling Hilbert or Peano curves require an infinite number of recursions.  Infinitely recursive functions are undecidable, and therefore space-filling curves are undecidable.  

Dimension-changing maps require an infinite number of recursions as well, and therefore dimension-changing maps are undecidable. For more on decidability, see [here](/solvable-periodicity.md).
