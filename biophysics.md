### The tree experiment

For a final argument, consider a patch of soil that recieves radiation from the sun.  This patch acts as a black box, radiating heat.  Now we plant a tree and wait for it to grow.  Nearly all the mass of a tree comes from the atmosphere, and this decreases entropy substantially because a gas has been converted into a solid.  The energy necessary for this process originates in sunlight, but what happens if we did not plant a tree at all?  The black box soil converts sunlight into heat and radiates that to the rest of the universe. Thus not only does the tree capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it reduces the amount of radiation as heat as it does so and both these processes decrease the entropy of the universe, relative to what it would have been if we had not planted the tree. 

This last sentence is the key: at a large scale, the radiation from the sun increases entropy over time.  But we don't care about that right now, what is interesting is that the increase is less than what it would have been had we not planted a tree.  Does the tree disobey the laws of thermodynamics?  It requires the input of energy via sunlight, and this energy does work that reduces entropy.  Furthermore, the energy dissipates as it is used: not even plants are completely efficient.

In dynamics this is called a forced dissipative system: energy enters from outside at regular intervals (via sunlight) and spreads out, leaving the system.
