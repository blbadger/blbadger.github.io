## Quantum mechanics 

Delayed choice, nonlocality, and more observations from small objects are considered here.

### An intuitive approach to delayed choice

Quantum mechanics is based on the particle-wave duality of small objects.  Such a duality was observed upon experimentation with light, which in some experimental apparatus behave as though they were particles and in other experiments behave as though they were waves.  An example of the former case is the excitation of electrons to discrete energy levels, and an example of the latter is the dual slit experiment in which a photon interferes with itself, as a macroscopic wave does, when travelling through two closely spaced slits.  Wave-like or particle-like behavior may be observed from objects such as photons or electrons (or even much larger things) but never both at the same time: this is the complementarity principle.

Wheeler devised a thought experiment, now known as the delayed choice, to test complementarity.  It proceeds as follows: suppose gravitational lensing were used to make a cosmic inferometer, which is a method for telling how far away something is.  With that information, it is possible to know the path a photon took as it travelled between galaxies.  Wheeler's hypothesis was that as a photon is neither a particle nor a wave until observed, but instead something indeterminate, then the act of observing the path choice would preclude a wave-like behavior manifest by

This experiment has been carried out, though not as Wheeler initially proposed.  In labs, it has been shown that the method used to observe a photon at the end of its path through a double slit with inferometer determines its wave or particle behavior in the entire apparatus, even through the double slit itself.  

One way to think about this is to try to understand when the photon 'learns' the experimental apparatus.  Now note that the Lorenz time dilation for a photon is infinite because it travels at the speed of light:

$$
\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \implies \\
\Delta t' \to \infty \; as \; v \to c 
$$

which means that from the photon's perspective, all events are simultaneous.  

If this is accepted, the question of when the photon learns the apparatus is moot because the ending time is equal to the start time.  A change in the method of recording the photon at the end of a photon flight can change its behavior through a double slit 20ns beforehand (in our reference) because  Delayed choice and quantum erasure would be more accurately thought of as a necessary result of simultaneity from a photon's perspective.

### Principle of least time as implied by delayed choice

Light travels at different speeds throught different materials.  For example, light travels through water (2.25E8 m/s)  slower than it does in vacuum (3E8 m/s). Fermat noted that light travels along paths in different media of refraction as if it chose the quickest way to get from point A to point B.  

### Nonlocality as implied by nonlinearity



### Renormalization
