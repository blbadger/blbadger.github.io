## Quantum mechanics 

Delayed choice, nonlocality, and more observations from small objects are considered here.  This commentary should be considered as provisional. 

### An intuitive approach to delayed choice

Quantum mechanics is based on the particle-wave duality of small objects.  Such a duality was observed upon experimentation with light, which in some experimental apparatus behave as though they were particles and in other experiments behave as though they were waves.  An example of the former case is the excitation of electrons to discrete energy levels, and an example of the latter is the dual slit experiment in which a photon interferes with itself, as a macroscopic wave does, when travelling through two closely spaced slits.  Wave-like or particle-like behavior may be observed from objects such as photons or electrons (or even much larger things) but never both at the same time: this is the complementarity principle.

Wheeler devised a thought experiment, now known as the delayed choice, to test complementarity.  It proceeds as follows: suppose gravitational lensing were used to make a cosmic inferometer, which is a method for telling how far away something is.  With that information, it is possible to know the path a photon took as it travelled between galaxies.  Wheeler's hypothesis was that as a photon is neither a particle nor a wave until observed, but instead something indeterminate, then the act of observing the path choice would preclude a wave-like behavior manifest by

This experiment has been carried out, though not as Wheeler initially proposed.  In labs, it has been shown that the method used to observe a photon at the end of its path through a double slit with inferometer determines its wave or particle behavior in the entire apparatus, even through the double slit itself.  

One way to think about this is to try to understand when the photon 'learns' the experimental apparatus.  Now note that the Lorenz time dilation for a photon is infinite because it travels at the speed of light:

$$
\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \implies \\
\Delta t' \to \infty \; as \; v \to c 
$$

which means that from the photon's perspective, all events are simultaneous.  

If this is accepted, the question of when the photon learns the apparatus is moot because the ending time is equal to the start time.  A change in the method of recording the photon at the end of a photon flight can change its behavior through a double slit 20ns beforehand (in our reference) because  Delayed choice and quantum erasure would be more accurately thought of as a necessary result of simultaneity from a photon's perspective.

### Principle of least time as implied by delayed choice

Light travels at different speeds throught different materials.  For example, light travels through water (2.25E8 m/s)  slower than it does in vacuum (3E8 m/s). Fermat noted that light travels along paths in different media of refraction as if it chose the quickest way to get from point A to point B.  Suppose that a new transparent material were invented and light was passed through it. When does light 'learn' what angle it should deflect to in order to minimize the time passing through this object? 

### Nonlocality implies a nonlinear space

'Spooky action at a distance', or what is now called quantum entanglement, is the phenomenon why which two particles interact such that in a future time at great distance, what happens to one affects what happens to the other (specifically with regards to quantum spin).  There is no intrinsic reasoning capable of explaining such behavior using vector (linear) space, but if one considers a nonlinear space then the result is implied.  

### Renormalization and scale

As noted by Feynmann, quantum particle paths are typically non-differentiable.  Equivalently, quantum paths exist in a fractal dimension greater than 1.  This means that the length of the particle path is infinite, because it increases (apparently indefinitely) as the observation resolution increases.  

This is not the only place where infinite quantities intrude in the study of small objects: the process of calculating field strength for quantum particles, for example, is rife with infinite quantities.  To deal with both issues, the theory of quantum renormalization was introduced to remove such infinities, allowing for calculation to proceed safely.

A necessity for renormalization as well as non-differentiable particle paths imply and are implied by scale invariance.  Scale invariance in turn is typical of nonlinear dynamical systems, and thus it is not a stretch of the imagination to propose that the mechanics of small objects are most accurately defined in terms of nonlinear dynamics. As the Schrodinger equation is linear, the current formulation is either incomplete or, as is more likely, a linear approximation.

### Implications for quantum mechanics

THe similarity between nondifferentiable motion in quantum particles and that observed for Brownian motion (see [here](https://blbadger.github.io/additivity-order.html) for more on Brownian motion) naively suggests a similar physical cause.  This implies that just as the particles undergoing Brownian motion are far larger than the water molecules causing this motion, there may well be particles much smaller than currently observed that buffet about the quantum bodies observed.  

### Electron orbitals and period doubling

A concrete example for how nonlinearity could be important for quantum mechanical systems is in atomic orbitals.  Consider that larger energies are required to attain each orbital in succession s, p, d, f and that the maximum number of locations (physically speaking, the distinct clouds) an electron can exist in for a given m value is, respectively, 1, 2, 4, 8.  

Now note that electron orbitals may be considered as the periodicity of electrons: one cloud corresponds to period one etc. Period doubling is typical of nonlinear systems upon an increase in energy, and therefore observed orbital geometry is consistent with period doubling.  If an electron absorbs enough energy, it is discharged from an orbital and travels freely, and most accurately in a non-differentiable path.  This is an aperiodic path with a fractal dimension greater than one, meaning that the process of energy addition to a bound electron (eventually freeing the particle) is consistent with that for a nonlinear attractor.
