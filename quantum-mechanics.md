## Quantum mechanics 

Delayed choice, nonlocality, and more observations from small objects are considered here.

### An intuitive approach to delayed choice

Wheeler devised a thought experiment, now known as the delayed choice.

One way to think about this is to try to understand when the photon 'learns' the experimental apparatus.

### Principle of least time as implied by delayed choice

Fermat noted that light travels along paths in different media of refraction as if it chose the quickest way to get from point A to point B

### Nonlocality as implied by nonlinearity



### Renormalization
