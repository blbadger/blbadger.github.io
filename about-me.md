## About Me

My name is Benjamin Badger and I hope you have enjoyed perusing these pages as much as I did making them.  Just completed my dissertation!

In my free time I enjoy playing music, spending time with friends, playing sports, reading, and occasionally fixing my car.

A playing a balanced game of smash bros. is a pleasure as well.
