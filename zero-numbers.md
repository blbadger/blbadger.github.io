### Counting and numbers

We can construct the natural numbers as sets of the empty set as follows:

$$
\varnothing \to 0 \\
\{\varnothing \} \to 1 \\
\{ \varnothing, \{\varnothing \} \} \to 2 \\
\{ \varnothing, \{\varnothing \}, \{ \varnothing, \{\varnothing \} \}  \} \to 3 \\
...
$$

With this definition, $\varnothing \in A$ for any given set $A$.  In fact, if any element of $A$ is examined, it is composed of elements that are composed of other elements that eventually are composed of the empty set.

Because of this, it is accurate to say that nothing composes everything. 

### Rational numbers as sets of equivalent fractions

Each rational number may be thought of as being the set of all equivalent fractions

$$
\frac{1}{2} = \{ \frac{-1}{-2}, \frac{5}{10}, \frac{15}{30}, \frac{2}{4}, \ldots \}
$$

with the rational number being the expression in lowest terms (positive if possible).  

There are therefore a countably infinite number of names for each rational number, as we can map

$$
\frac{1}{2} = \{ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{4}, \frac{3}{6}, \frac{4}{8}, \ldots \}
$$

to $\Bbb N$ by taking the numerator as our value in $\Bbb N$.  

Irrational numbers, however, cannot be represented as fractions and therefore only have one member in the set of elements:

$$
e = \{ e \}
$$

because expressions like 

$$
\frac{2e}{2}, \frac{3e}{3} ...
$$

are not accurate representations of $e$. This is because these numbers by definition are rational (expressed by fractions
