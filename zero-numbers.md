### Counting and numbers

We can construct the natural numbers as sets of the empty set as follows:

$$
\varnothing \to 0 \\
\{\varnothing \} \to 1 \\
\{ \varnothing, \{\varnothing \} \} \to 2 \\
\{ \varnothing, \{\varnothing \}, \{ \varnothing, \{\varnothing \} \}  \} \to 3 \\
...
$$

With this definition, $\varnothing \in A$ for any given set $A$.  In fact, if any element of $A$ is examined, it is composed of elements that are composed of other elements that eventually are composed of the empty set.

Because of this, it is accurate to say that nothing composes everything.
