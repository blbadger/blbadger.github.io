## Masked Mixers II

We continue exploring topics from [Part I}(https://blbadger.github.io/smaller-lms.html), with a more thorough version of these results found in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01482)
Application of masked mixers to larger datasets will be explored, theory is expanded, and the nature of the learned structure of masked mixers versus transformers is investigated.
