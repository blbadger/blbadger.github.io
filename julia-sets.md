## Julia sets

A Julia (named after Gaston Julia) set is the boundary of the sets of unbounded and bounded iterates of the equation

$$
f_a(x) = x^2 + a 
\tag{1}
$$

where $a$ is fixed and $x_0$ varies about the complex plane $x + yi$.  
This means that any number in the complex plane is in the Julia set if it borders another number $u$ 
such that $f^k_a(u) \to \infty \; \mathbf {as} \; k \to \infty$ as well as a number $c$ where 
$f^k_a(c) \not\to \infty \; \mathbf {as} \; k \to \infty$.
