### Brownian motion converts heat to work, albeit briefly

What about at scales more relavant to our existance: does an increase in entropy over time always occur?  At a scale slightly smaller than our own, there is indeed. 

The chaotic motion of small particles in fluid is called Brownian motion, after the naturalist who identified this as a process independant of life.  Brownian motion is the result of the summation of thermal motions of many molecules of liquid pushing against a larger particle. These molecular motions cause the particle to move through the surrounding liquid in a 

Over brief period of time and in a small scale, brownian motion is a conversion of heat energy to work, or equivalently the conversion of undirected motion to directed motion.
