## The developmental genetic problem

### Background

The hereditery material of living organisms is (mostly) a polymer called deoxyribonucleic acid, usually referred to as DNA.  The DNA forms very long strands in many cells, with some estimates putting the total length at over six feet per total DNA (called the genome) in each of ours.  

A surprise came when the genomes of various animals and plants were first investigated: body complexity is not correlated with genome length.  To give a particularly dramatic example of this phenomenon, it has been observed that the single-cell, half-millimeter-sized *Amoeba proteus* has a genome length of 290 billion (short billion, ie $10^9$) base pairs with is two orders of magnitude longer than our own (~3 billion base pairs). 

When the human genome project was completed, the number of sections of DNA that encode proteins (genes) was estimated at around 22 thousand, which is not an inconsiderable number but far fewer than expected at the time.  It was found that the vast majority of the human genome does not encode proteins but instead is a combination of repeat sequences left over from retroviruses, regulatory regions, and extended introns.

It could be hypothesized that the large amount of non-coding DNA is essential for the development of a complex body plan by providing extra regulatory regions.  But even this is doubtful: the pufferfish *Tetraodontidae rubripes* contains a compact genome an eighth of the size of ours, and being a chordate retains an intricate body.

How then does the relatively small genome specify an incredibly detailed body of, for example, a vertebrate?  In Edelman's book Topobiology, the developmental genetic problem is laid out as follows: how can a one-dimensional molecule encode all the information necessary for a three-dimensional body plan, given the incredible level of detail in which it must act?

### How genetics are encoded

To gain more perspective on just how difficult this problem seems, consider the memory requirements necessary to store 1- or 2- versus 3-dimensional arrays as a proxy for information content in each of these objects...

A way to understand how this is possible is to consider the other pages of this website.  There, we see many examples of small and relatively simple equations give rise to extremly intricate and infinitely detailed patterns.  An important thing to remember about these equations are that they are differential equations: they specify a change over time, and that they are all nonlinear (piecewise linear equations can also form comlicated patterns, but for our purposes we can classify piecewise linear equations as nonlinear).  

If simple nonlinear differential equations can give rise to extremely complex maps, perhaps a relatively simple genetic code could specify a complex body by acting as instructions not for the body directly but instead for parameters that over time specify a body.  In this way, the genetic code could be described as a ...
