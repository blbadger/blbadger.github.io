## Continuity and aperiodicity

For this page, *aperiodic* signifies dynamical systems that are bounded (ie do not diverge to infinity) and lack periodicity.  Specifically, phase space portraits of ODEs are considered.  Unbounded dynamical systems may also be thought of as being aperiodic but are not considered.  On this page, a 'map' is synonymous with a 'function'.  Each heading is a theorem, with proof following (sometimes informal).
