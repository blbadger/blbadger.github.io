## About me:
My name is Benjamin Badger and I hope you have enjoyed perusing these pages as much as I did making them.  
Currently writing my thesis.

In my free time I enjoy playing music, hanging out with friends, playing sports, and reading, and occasionally
even surveying the sky by day or night.
