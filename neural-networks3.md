## Interpretable Deep Learning

Relying on the ability of deep learning techniques to be sufficient to learn successive representations of an input, we explore extremely flexible yet interpretable neural networks.

### Introduction and background

Deep learning approaches are often touted for having greater accuracy than other machine learning approaches, and this is often true.

### Flexible Inputs: Recurrent Neural Networks

### Seq
