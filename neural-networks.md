## Image classification with a convolutional neural network

Say that you were tasked with classifying images using an automated system, one that does not depend on user input.  There could be many reasons for this, and the one that motivated the making of this particular network was an effort to assess reproducibility.  I have taken many images of biological specimens (usually fluorescence images of cells) over the last decade, and think I have gotten pretty good at determining which images are of what category.  Can an automated system perform this task as good or better than me?

The current state-of-the-art method for classifying images is with neural networks.  [Keras introduction](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) and [load image](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images?hl=TR) tutorials
