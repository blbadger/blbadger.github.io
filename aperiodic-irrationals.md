The equivalence between aperiodicity and irrational numbers may be used in a proof for Lorenz's observation that aperiodic ordinary differential equation systems are sensitive to changes in initial values:

The same statement can also be reasoned as follows: say that points close together are stable if they stay close together in the arbitraty future, or are unstable if they diverge.  Now suppose that all points are unstable, such that all points that start close together move apart after a number of iterations. This is equivalent to saying that a system is sensitive to changes in initial values.  Now being that every starting initial value will eventually have different outputs than the value's neighbor (for any 'neighbor size'), each initial value has a unique trajectory.  As there is an uncountably infinite number of possible starting values on the interval $(0,1]$, there is an uncountably infinite number of possible trajectories.  We can establish a one-to-one correspondence between periodic trajectories and rational numbers, and there are countably many rational numbers and thus countably many periodic trajectories if trajectories are periodic. But we have earlier seen that there must be uncountably many trajectories, thus trajectories must be aperiodic.  Therefore instability (sensitivity) at all initial points is equivalent to aperiodicity $\square$.
