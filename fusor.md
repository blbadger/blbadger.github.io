### Fusors: internal electrostatic containment devices

## Fusor under high power

Fusors use electrostatic potential to confine plasma in order to accomplish nuclear fusion.
This is a demo model, built only to display the plasma containment and does not fuse nuclei
to any extent.

## Fusor vacuum chamber construction

Fusor contain plasma with an electrostatic grid pair.  Here, the outer 'grid' is the 
vacuum coupling on the left and the inner grid is front and center.
