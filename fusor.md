## Fusors: internal electrostatic containment devices

### Fusor under high power 

Fusors use electrostatic potential to confine plasma in order to accomplish nuclear fusion.
This is a demo model, built only to display the plasma containment and does not fuse nuclei
to any extent.  The small vacuum chamber self-rectifies, and the fusor is running here on a
14 kV @ 70mA AC input.

### Fusor under low power (~400 V AC)

### Fusor vacuum chamber, power off

Fusor contain plasma with an electrostatic grid pair.  Here, the outer 'grid' is the 
vacuum coupling on the left and the inner grid is front and center.
