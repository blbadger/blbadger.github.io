## Tesla Coils: high voltage resonant transformers

High voltage arcs.  Beautiful to witness!

Specs: ~4 kVA power input with a 120nF primary capacitor (multi-mini capacitor style, made from surplus WIMA FKP1 pulse capacitors) and an ASRG spark gap running at ~500 bps. Power supply is 4 microwave oven 
transformers, primaries wired in parallel with secondaries in series
(floating cores, and all submerged in oil) for a power ouput of 10 kV
at 400mA.  Power controlled with a variable autotransformer, up to 
145V output with 120V input. The topload is two aluminum dryer ducts.

Primary coil is ~8 turns of 0.25" refrigerator tubing, secondary coil
is 1100 turns of AWG 22 magnet wire on an 8" inner diameter concrete 
forming tube coated in polyurethane. Inner turns of the primary get 
warm during operation, not suprising with an estimated 18.9 kA instantaneous 
current during capacitor discharge.

### Very large topload test

A rubber inner tube was inflated and covered in aluminum tape to make a very large toroidal topload (5' diameter).  This method is not recommended without the use of a forming substance (paper miche or plaster etc) covering the tube because the high voltage arcs will puncture the rubber even when protected via metal tape.  This is the last generation of the coil above, as the secondary base experienced severe flashovers resulting in vaporization of parts of the lower windings.  > 7' arcs!

### Early generation coil

Same primary circuit as described above.  Secondary coil is a 4" diameter PVC wound 
with 1300 turns of AWG 26 magnet wire. 3kVA input, smaller dryer duct toroids, smaller primary capacitor (~ 50 nF).
