## Tesla Coils: high voltage resonant transformers

High voltage arcs.  Beautiful to witness!

Specs: ~4 kVA power input using an ASRG spark gap running at ~500 bps, made from a variable-speed angle grinder with a PE disk used to secure four brass electrodes (iron has high RF losses and becomes too hot to use with PE).

The primary circuit capacitor is 120nF multi-mini capacitor style, made from a few hundred surplus WIMA FKP1 pulse capacitors usually found in industrial lasers. Power supplied by 4 microwave oven transformers, primaries wired in parallel with secondaries in series (floating cores, and all submerged in mineral oil) for a power ouput of 10 kV at ~400mA.  Not pretty but a very robust power source.

Power controlled with a variable autotransformer (for low power runs), up to 
145V output with 120V input.

The topload is two aluminum dryer ducts forming a double stacked toroid, each stack 8" by 2.5'. Primary coil is ~8 turns of 0.25" refrigerator tubing, secondary coil is 1100 turns of AWG 22 magnet wire on an 8" inner diameter concrete  forming tube coated in polyurethane. The inner turns of the primary get  warm during operation, not suprising with an estimated 18.9 kA instantaneous current during capacitor discharge.

### Very large topload test

A rubber inner tube was inflated and covered in aluminum tape to make a very large toroidal topload (5' diameter).  This method is not recommended without the use of a forming substance (paper miche or plaster etc) covering the tube because the high voltage arcs will puncture the rubber even when protected via metal tape.  This is the last generation of the coil above, as the secondary base experienced severe flashovers resulting in vaporization of parts of the lower windings.  > 7' arcs!

### Early generation coil

This coil was based on a secondary coil wound on a 4" diameter PVC with 1300 turns of AWG 26 magnet wire. 3kVA input from the microwave oven transformer above but with an air core inductive current limiter, smaller dryer duct toroids, smaller primary capacitor (~ 50 nF) make from WIMA MKP-10 pulse capacitors (which are by design not as durable as FKP-1 but are cheaper).

Note the bleed resistors at the top: I have not found these to be necessary for new capacitors (with no dielectric memory) used on tesla coils, but it is generally a good idea to include some form of current dissipation for large capacitors like these.

The primary and secondary coil setup on wood supports, with an angle grinder-based ASRG in the ground to the right and the capacitor bank underneath the primary.
