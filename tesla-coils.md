## Tesla Coils: high voltage resonant transformers

High voltage sparks and arcs.  Beautiful to see live!

Specs: 4 kVA power input with a 120nF primary capacitor and an
ASRG spark gap running at ~500 bps. Power supply is 4 microwave oven 
transformers, primaries wired in parallel with secondaries in series
(floating cores, all submerged in oil) for a power ouput of 10 kV
at 400mA.  Power controlled with a variable autotransformer, up to 
145V output with 120V input. Topload is of two aluminum dryer ducts.

Primary coil is ~8 turns of 0.25" refrigerator tubing, secondary coil
is 1100 turns of AWG 22 magnet wire on an 8" inner diameter concrete 
forming tube coated in polyurethane. Inner turns of the primary get 
warm during operation, not suprising with an estimated 18.9 kA instantaneous 
current during capacitor firing!

### Earlier generation coil

Same primary circuit as described above.  Secondary coil is4" diameter PVC wound 
with 1300 turns of AWG 26 magnet wire. 3kVA input, smaller dryer duct toroids.
