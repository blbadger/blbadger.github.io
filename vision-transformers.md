## Vision Transformers

### Introduction

The [convolutional neural network](https://blbadger.github.io/neural-networks.html) has been the mainstay of deep learning vision approaches for decades, dating back to the work of [LeCun and colleagues](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1989/file/53c3bce66e43be4f209556518c2fcb54-Paper.pdf) in 1989. In that work, it was proposed that restrictions on model capacity would be necessary to prevent over-parametrized fully connected models from failing to generalize.
